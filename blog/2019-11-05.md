# And so it begins...

Hello and welcome to the official blog of team     indentaition error!

## About us:

We're a team of (mostly) first cear comp sci students who, surprisingly enough, have left their rooms and even their houses!
Needless to say, we have no idea what were're doing but we're going to make an attempt nonetheless.

But before you read through our weekly escapades, you're going to need to know who's who on the team:

* Line Macaire
  * Our supivisor, orginiser of many things
  * > "Dan/Joe, it's your job!"

* Dan Lange
  * > "ok :("
  
* Alex Baldwin
  * > _"Graphic design is my passion"_
  
* Joe Gardner
  * > "What am I doing again?"
  
* Robin Naghshbandi
  * > "Your attendance for this lecture has not been recorded"
  
* William Evans
  * > "Managing a blog under Alex's dictatorship"
  
And who could forget the grand overseer of all the teams and the project as a whole:

* Colin Sauze
  * Boat master, master of boats
